#getSinceraData

This repository contains a simple script to fetch the Sincera ecosystem data. The API key is provided via the `SINCERA_API_KEY` GitHub secret. When run, the script stores the result in `output/ecosystem_data.json` and uploads it to an S3 bucket if `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` is set.

## Usage

Ensure that the `SINCERA_API_KEY` environment variable is available (for example via GitHub Actions secrets). To upload the file to S3 you must also configure the AWS role via `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` and provide the bucket name in `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`.

```bash
./scripts/fetch_sincera_data.sh
```

## Reference sellers lists

On every merge into `main`, a GitHub Actions workflow downloads the latest `sellers.json` files from SheMedia, CafeMedia, and Mediavine. The files are committed to the `reference_sellers_lists/` directory.
